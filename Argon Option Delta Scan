# Argon Option Delta Scan

#Use the TOS Option Filters to set Volume and Days to Exp

# Looks for Options which can be sold for more than their Probability ITM.
# The value of selling the Option is found by subtracting the next OTM option from the current.
# The Probability ITM is approximated with the Option Delta.
# Because options can be for $1, $0.50 or $2.50 etc the value is divided by the difference in strikes to assess risk.
# Finally there is a Profit Factor so it can look for options giving a profit larger than a set ratio.
